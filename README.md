# Range.pas
A Delphi library for generic manipulations of enumerable objects.

What it does:
- enables uniform treatment of `TEnumerable` objects and `arrays`
- enables creation of `pipelines` of enumerables with automatic lifetime management, through the use of `TAutomaticRange`
- provides types `TGenerator` and `TFunctionEnumerator` for creation of user-defined generators and enumerators.
